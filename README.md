# JS Endpoint Keyword Search Tool

The JS Endpoint Keyword Search Tool is a Python script that allows you to search for specific keywords within the content of JavaScript (JS) endpoints. It can help you identify sensitive information or potential security vulnerabilities in JS files.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- The `subprocess`, `re`, and `colorama` modules installed (`pip install subprocess re colorama`)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.

2. Create a text file named `jsfiles.txt` in the same directory as the script.

3. Populate `jsfiles.txt` with the URLs of the JS endpoints you want to search, each URL on a new line.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

6. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python script.py
